# Flexible Naive Bayes
A comparative study between Naive Bayes Classifier and Flexible Bayes Classifier. 4 bandwidth selection methods are used: Scott's Factor, Silverman's rule of thumb, Least Square Cross Validation and Maximum Likelihood Cross Likelihood.

## Simulation
Data generated from both Gaussian and non Gaussian Distribution and compared the predictive accuracies between Naive Bayes and Flexible Bayes Classifier.

### 1. Gaussian Distribution
Data are generated from a multivariate gaussian distribution where the location parameter is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)' and scale parameter is 1.

* Number of classes is 5
* Class sizes are respectively 100, 110, 95, 101, 99.

|Classifier|Train Accuracy|Test Accuracy|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Naive Bayes |0.8237|0.8823|
|Flexible Bayes (scott)|0.9801|0.8431|
|Flexible Bayes (Silverman)|0.9845|0.8627|
|Flexible Bayes (CV-LS)|0.9713|0.7647|
|Flexible Bayes (CV-ML)|0.9581|0.8039|

### 2. Non-Gaussian Distribution
Data are generated from a multivariate laplace distribution with the location parameter is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)' and scale parameter 1.

* Number of classes is 5
* Class sizes are respectively 100, 110, 95, 101, 99.
